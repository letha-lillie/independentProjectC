# _Third Independent Project for Evening Epicodus Class_

#### _A Ping-Pong website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, & jQuery, with an emphasis on looping & arrays._

#### By **Ann Kathryn Roberts**

## Description:

_This project is designed to practice looping with for, if...else statements, etc. This is a 'ping-pong game' that returns a list of numbers from 1 - (X) based on user input, and replaces numbers divisible by 3, 5, or 15 with words._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

## Known Bugs

Not a bug per se, but I would like to put the output into two or more columns, in case the user chooses a very large number!
